Generic Tagged Arrays: Reserved Tags
====================================

Tag names that are not defined in this section should be preceded with the two
characters "X-". If they are some day included in this specification, the "X-"
prefix is removed. This way, conflicts between existing files and future
versions of this specification are avoided.

Tag names can use the character '/' to denote tag directories, thereby
creating tag namespaces. For example, an application FooBar might use tag
names of the form "X-FOOBAR/COLOR/BACKGROUND" or "X-FOOBAR/AUDIO/BASS",
effectively creating its private namespace "X-FOOBAR" with the directories
"COLOR" and "AUDIO".


The following tag namespaces are reserved:

- "TIFF/": Reserved for tags defined and used by the Tagged Image File Format;
  see for example <http://www.awaresystems.be/imaging/tiff.html>. The tag itself
  is specified using its name (case-independent), e.g. "TIFF/MaxSampleValue".
  This namespace is also used by extension tags, for example those defined by
  the GeoTIFF specification <http://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/>.

- "PFS/": Reserved for tags defined and used by the PFS format; see
  <http://pfstools.sourceforge.net/documentation.html>.

- "GDAL/": Reserved for tags used by the GDAL library.

- "NETCDF/": Reserved for tags used by NetCDF.


The following tag names are defined for global tags in a GTA file:

- "CREATOR": Creator information.

- "PRODUCER": Producer information (usually the software that produced the array
  data).

- "DATE": Date associated with the GTA data, in the format specified by RFC 2822
  Sec. 3.3. Example: "Fri,  4 Dec 2009 22:29:43 +0100 (CET)".

- "DESCRIPTION": Human readable description of the content.

- "COPYRIGHT": Copyright information.


The following tag names are defined for dimension tags in a GTA file:

- "INTERPRETATION": This tag describes how the dimension should be interpreted by
  the application. Currently defined values are
  - "X": X axis of an euclidean space
  - "Y": Y axis of an euclidean space
  - "Z": Z axis of an euclidean space
  - "T": time axis

- "SAMPLE-DISTANCE": This tag describes the distance of sample points for
  dimensions with equidistant sampling. The value may be followed by a SI unit,
  e.g. m for meters. If a SI unit is used, the SAMPLE-DISTANCE tags of all
  dimensions must use the same unit.


The following tag names are defined for component tags in a GTA file:

- "INTERPRETATION": This tag describes how the component should be interpreted
  by the application. Currently defined values are
  - "GRAY": Graylevel value for colors
  - "RED": Red color component of an unspecified color space
  - "GREEN": Green color component of an unspecified color space
  - "BLUE": Blue color component of an unspecified color space
  - "ALPHA": Alpha component for colors
  - "SRGB/RED": Red color component of the sRGB color space
  - "SRGB/GREEN": Green color component of the sRGB color space
  - "SRGB/BLUE": Blue color component of the sRGB color space
  - "XYZ/X": X color component of the CIE XYZ color space
  - "XYZ/Y": Y color component of the CIE XYZ color space
  - "XYZ/Z": Z color component of the CIE XYZ color space
  - "HSL/H": H color component of the HSL color space
  - "HSL/S": S color component of the HSL color space
  - "HSL/L": L color component of the HSL color space
  - "YCBCR/Y": Y color component of the YCbCr color space
  - "YCBCR/CB": Cb color component of the YCbCr color space
  - "YCBCR/CR": Cr color component of the YCbCr color space
  - "CMYK/C": C color component of the CMYK color space
  - "CMYK/M": M color component of the CMYK color space
  - "CMYK/Y": Y color component of the CMYK color space
  - "CMYK/K": K color component of the CMYK color space

- "DESCRIPTION": Human readable description of the component.

- "UNIT": SI unit symbol that describes the unit for the values of this
  component. The value can be any SI unit symbol with or without prefix.
  The value must use UTF-8 characters instead of plain ASCII where applicable,
  e.g. the middle dot instead of '*'.

- "NO_DATA_VALUE": Special value that indicates that there is no data
  available for an array element.

- "MIN_VALUE": Minimal value of this component in this array.

- "MAX_VALUE": Maximum value of this component in this array.

First, replicate the functionality of CVLView
<http://cvtool.sourceforge.net/cvlview.html>:
- Add "show grid" option
- Add info area that shows value(s) under cursor
- Add luminance histogram for color view
- Add simple 3D view, with z component taken from gta tags

Then, extent existing functionality:
- Add isolines option
- For 3D view, add radial depth view and some method to get
  field of view right (from tag metadata)

At that point, we should have 2D scalar fields supported pretty nicely.

Then, add support for new view modes:
- Point Clouds
- 3D scalar fields (Volume Raycasting)
- 2D vector fields
- 3D vector fields
- ...
